- Support for various operations including:
  - File formatting
  - Date analysis
  - JSON processing
  - Log file analysis
  - Email extraction
  - Credit card number extraction
  - Similarity analysis
  - Database operations
  - API interactions

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t automation-agent .
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```bash

   ```

## API Endpoints
